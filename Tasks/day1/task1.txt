  http1.1 vs http2
http1.1
   In http1.1 the data the resources are load one after the other, it doesnt allow developers to prioritize which loads first in web page, so it is less efficient than http2.
http2
  In http2, it uses multiplexing that is within a single TCP connection it can send multiple streams of data at once and also allows developers to prioritize content which loaded first
  ,hence it loads faster than http1.1 and more efficient.
